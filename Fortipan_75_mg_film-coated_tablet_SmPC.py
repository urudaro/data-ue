In a 2-year, double-blind, multicentre study comparing risedronate sodium 5 mg daily (n= 613) and risedronate sodium 75 mg tablets on two consecutive days a month (n=616) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the overall safety profiles were similar. The following additional adverse experiences considered possibly or probably drug related by investigators and at a frequency of at least 1% have been reported (incidence greater in risedronate sodium 75 mg than in risedronate sodium 5 mg group): gastritis erosive (1.5% vs 0.8%), vomiting (1.3% vs 1.1%), arthralgia (1.5% vs 1.0%), bone pain (1.1% vs 0.5%) and pain in extremity (1.1% vs 0.5%). Laboratory findings: Early, transient, asymptomatic and mild decreases in serum calcium and phosphate levels have been observed in some patients. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-marketing use (frequency unknown): Eye disorders: iritis, uveitis Muskuloskeletal and connective tissues disorders: osteonecrosis of the jaw Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: hypersensitivity and skin reactions, including angioedema, generalised rash, urticaria and bullous skin reactions, some severe including isolated reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. hair loss Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction Hepatobiliary disorders: serious hepatic disorders. In most of the reported cases the patients were also treated with other products known to cause hepatic disorders.']]]],

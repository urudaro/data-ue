Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon: Photosensitivity reaction. General disorders and administration site conditions Common: Asthenia, oedema. Investigations Very common: Elevated plasma prolactin levels, but associated clinical manifestations (e.g. gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, and breast enlargement) were rare. In most patients, levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment. Uncommon: High creatine phosphokinase 1 In clinical trials with olanzapine in over 5,000 patients with baseline non-fasting glucose levels \u22647.8 mmol/l, the incidence of non-fasting plasma glucose levels \u226511 mmol/l (suggestive of diabetes) was 1.0% compared to 0.9% with placebo. The incidence of non-fasting plasma glucose levels \u22658.9 mmol/l but <11 mmol/l (suggestive of hyperglycaemia) was 2.0% compared to 1.6% with placebo. Hyperglycaemia is also reported as a very rare spontaneous event. 2 In clinical trials, the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher, but not statistically significantly different from placebo. Olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol. In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders, it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and/or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes. The following table of undesirable effects is based on post-marketing spontaneous reports.']]]],

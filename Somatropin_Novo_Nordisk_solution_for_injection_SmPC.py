In above) children injection site reaction In children with Turner syndrome increased growth of hands and feet has been reported during somatropin therapy. A tendency for increased incidence of otitis media in Turner syndrome patients treated with high doses of Norditropin has been observed in one open-label randomised clinical trial. However, the increase in ear infections did not result in more ear operations/ tube insertions compared to the lower dose group in the trial. Post marketing experience: Very rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported (see section 4.3). Formation of antibodies directed against somatropin has been rarely observed during Norditropin therapy. The titres and binding capacities of these antibodies have been very low and have not interfered with the growth response to Norditropin administration. Very rare cases of decrease in serum thyroxin levels have been reported during treatment with somatropin (see section 4.4). Increase in blood alkaline phosphatase level may be seen during the treatment with somatropin. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calv\xe9-Perthes disease have been reported in children treated with somatropin. Slipped Capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders, and Legg-Calv\xe9-Perthes disease may occur more frequently in patients with short stature, and it is not known whether the frequency of these medical conditions is higher in somatropin treated children. These diseases may present as the development of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain, and physicians and parents should be alerted to this possibility. Very rare cases of benign intracranial hypertension have been reported. Very rare cases of diabetes mellitus type 2 have been reported, but most of the available literature does not demonstrate an increased incidence of diabetes associated with somatropin treatment.']]]],

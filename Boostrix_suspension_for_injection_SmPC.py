              u'Anaphylactic reaction, allergic reaction For adults and adolescents from the age of 10 years onwards (N = 1,515) Clinical trials: Blood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon: lymphadenopathy Nervous system disorders Very common: headache Common: dizziness Uncommon: hypertonia Gastrointestinal disorders Uncommon: vomiting Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon: hyperhidrosis, pruritus Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon: myalgia, joint stiffness Infections and infestations Uncommon: pharyngitis General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: injection site reactions (such as redness and/or swelling), injection site pain Common: pyrexia (fever >37.5\xb0C), malaise, fatigue Uncommon: pyrexia (fever > 39.0\xb0C), injection site mass, injection site abscess sterile, pain Post-marketing surveillance: General disorders and administration site conditions Oedematous swelling of the injected limb Immune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction, allergic reaction Data on 146 subjects suggest that there might be a small increase in local reactogenicity (pain, redness, swelling) with repeated vaccination according to a 0, 1, 6 months schedule in adults (> 40 years of age). Data suggest that in subjects primed with DTP in childhood a booster dose might give an increase of local reactogenicity. Following administration of tetanus toxoid containing vaccines, there have been very rare reports of adverse reactions on the central or peripheral nervous systems, including ascending paralysis or even respiratory paralysis (e.g. Guillain-Barr\xe9 syndrome).']]]],

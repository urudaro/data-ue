In a 4 year clinical trial, the general pattern of adverse event distribution was similar to that reported for the 1 and 2 year studies with the total incidence of gastrointestinal related adverse events occurring in year 1 decreasing year on year over the four year period. The following table of undesirable effects is based on post-marketing spontaneous reports, and therefore the frequency remains unknown: SYSTEM ORGAN CLASS ADVERSE REACTION Investigations Increase in liver transaminases and in alkaline phosphatase. Decreased prothrombin, increased INR and unbalanced anticoagulant treatment resulting in variations of haemostatic parameters have been reported in patients treated with anticoagulants in association with orlistat (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Gastrointestinal disorders Rectal bleeding (see section 4.4) Diverticulitis Pancreatitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Bullous eruptions Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity (e.g. pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis) Hepatobiliary disorders Cholelithiasis Hepatitis that may be serious Renal and urinary disorders Oxalate nephropathy']]]],

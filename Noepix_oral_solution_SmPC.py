Injury, poisoning and procedural complications Common: accidental injury Description of selected adverse reactions The risk of anorexia is higher when topiramate is coadministered with levetiracetam. In several cases of alopecia, recovery was observed when levetiracetam was discontinued. Paediatric population A study conducted in paediatric patients (4 to 16 years) with partial onset seizures showed that 55.4 % of the patients in the levetiracetam group and 40.2 % of the patients in the placebo group experienced adverse reactions. Serious adverse reactions were experienced in none of the patients in the levetiracetam group and 1.0 % of the patients in the placebo group. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were somnolence, hostility, nervousness, emotional lability, agitation, anorexia, asthenia and headache in the paediatric population. Safety results in paediatric patients were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and psychiatric adverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults (38.6 % versus 18.6 %). However, the relative risk was similar in children as compared to adults. A study conducted in paediatric patients (1 month to less than 4 years) with partial onset seizures showed that 21.7 % of the patients in the levetiracetam group and 7.1 % of the patients in the placebo group experienced adverse reactions. No serious adverse reactions were experienced in patients in the levetiracetam or placebo group. During the long-term follow-up study N01148, the most frequent drug related treatment-emergent adverse reactions in the 1 month \u2013 <4 years group were irritability (7.9 %), convulsion (7.2 %), somnolence (6.6 %), psychomotor hyperactivity (3.3 %), sleep disorder (3.3 %), and aggression (3.3 %). Safety results in paediatric patients were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in older children aged 4 to 16 years. A double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed the cognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with partial onset seizures. It was concluded that levetiracetam was not different (non inferior) from placebo with regard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory Screen Composite score in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional functioning indicated a worsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behaviour as measured in a standardised and systematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL \u2013 Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist). However subjects, who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label follow-up study, did not experience a worsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional functioning; in particular measures of aggressive behaviour were not worse than baseline.']]]],

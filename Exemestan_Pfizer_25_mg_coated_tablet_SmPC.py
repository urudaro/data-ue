An occasional decrease in lymphocytes has been observed in approximately 20% of patients receiving Exemestane Pfizer, particularly in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia; however, mean lymphocyte values in these patients did not change significantly over time and no corresponding increase in viral infections was observed. These effects have not been observed in patients treated in early breast cancer studies. Hepatobiliary disorders Elevation of liver function test parameters including enzymes, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase have been observed. The table below presents the frequency of pre-specified adverse events and illnesses in the early breast cancer study (IES), irrespective of causality, reported in patients receiving trial therapy and up to 30 days after cessation of trial therapy. Exemestane Tamoxifen Adverse events and illnesses (N = 2249) (N = 2279) Hot flushes 491 (21.8%) 457 (20.1%) Fatigue 367 (16.3%) 344 (15.1%) Headache 305 (13.6%) 255 (11.2%) Insomnia 290 (12.9%) 204 (9.0%) Sweating increased 270 (12.0%) 242 (10.6%) Gynaecological 235 (10.5%) 340 (14.9%) Dizziness 224 (10.0%) 200 (8.8%) Nausea 200 (8.9%) 208 (9.1%) Osteoporosis 116 (5.2%) 66 (2.9%) Vaginal haemorrhage 90 (4.0%) 121 (5.3%) Other primary cancer 84 (3.6%) 125 (5.3%) Vomiting 50 (2.2%) 54 (2.4%) Visual disturbance 45 (2.0%) 53 (2.3%) Thromboembolism 16 (0.7%) 42 (1.8%) Osteoporotic fracture 14 (0.6%) 12 (0.5%) Myocardial infarction 13 (0.6%) 4 (0.2%) In the IES study, the frequency of ischemic cardiac events in the exemestane and tamoxifen treatment arms was 4.5% versus 4.2%, respectively. No significant difference was noted for any individual cardiovascular event including hypertension (9.9% versus 8.4%), myocardial infarction (0.6% versus 0.2%) and cardiac failure (1.1% versus 0.7%). In the IES study, exemestane was associated with a greater incidence of hypercholesterolemia compared with tamoxifen (3.7% vs. 2.1%). In a separate double blinded, randomized study of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer at low risk treated with exemestane (N=73) or placebo (N=73) for 24 months , exemestane was associated with an average 7-9% mean reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol, versus a 1% increase on placebo. There was also a 5-6% reduction in apolipoprotein A1 in the exemestane group versus 0-2% for placebo. The effect on the other lipid parameters analysed (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B and lipoprotein-a) was very similar in the two treatment groups . The clinical significance of these results is unclear. In the IES study, gastric ulcer was observed at a higher frequency in the exemestane arm compared to tamoxifen (0.7% versus <0.1%). The majority of patients on exemestane with gastric ulcer received concomitant treatment with non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents and/or had a prior history. Adverse reactions from post-marketing experience Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis Because reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.']]]],

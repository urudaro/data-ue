General disorders and administration site conditions: Rare: asthenia An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included some of the following features: angioedema, lupus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, ESR increased, arthritis and arthralgia, urticaria, photosensitivity, fever, flushing, dyspnoea and malaise.

Investigations: Rare: increases in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase) (see section 4.4 Hepatic effects), elevated alkaline phosphatase; increase in serum CK levels (see section 4.4). Children and adolescents (10-17 years of age) In a 48-week study involving children and adolescents (boys Tanner Stage II and above and girls who were at least one year post-menarche) 10-17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (n = 175), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with Simvastatin was generally similar to that of the group treated with placebo. The long-term effects on physical, intellectual, and sexual maturation are unknown. No sufficient data are currently available after one year of treatment. (See sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1.)']]]],

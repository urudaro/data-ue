              u'ecchymosis) Very rare: thrombocytopenia Immune system disorders Very rare: allergic reactions (including urticaria and angioedema) Endocrine disorders Very rare: syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Metabolism and nutrition disorders Common: decreased appetite Rare: hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia has been reported predominantly in elderly patients and is sometimes due to syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Psychiatric disorders Common: somnolence, insomnia, agitation Uncommon: confusion, hallucinations Rare: (see section 4.4) ,manic reactions, anxiety, depersonalisation, panic attacks and frequency not known: Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during paroxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). These symptoms may also be due to the underlying disease. Nervous system disorders Common: dizziness, tremor Uncommon: extrapyramidal disorders Rare: psychomotor restlessness/akathisia (see section 4.4), convulsions Very rare: serotonin syndrome (symptoms may include agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, hallucinations, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, shivering, tachycardia and tremor) Reports of extrapyramidal disorder including oro-facial dystonia have been received in patients sometimes with underlying movement disorders or who were using neuroleptic medicinal products. Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Very rare: acute glaucoma Cardiac disorders Uncommon: sinus tachycardia Rare: bradycardia Vascular disorders Uncommon: transient increases or decreases in blood pressure Transient increases or decreases of blood pressure have been reported following treatment with paroxetine, usually in patients with pre-existing hypertension or anxiety. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Common: yawning Gastrointestinal disorders Very common: nausea Common: constipation, diarrhoea, dry mouth Very rare: gastrointestinal bleeding Hepato-biliary disorders Rare: elevation of hepatic enzymes Very rare: hepatic events (such as hepatitis, sometimes associated with jaundice and/or liver failure) Elevation of hepatic enzymes have been reported. Post-marketing reports of hepatic events (such as hepatitis, sometimes associated with jaundice and/or liver failure) have also been received very rarely. Discontinuation of paroxetine should be considered if there is prolonged elevation of liver function test results. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: sweating Uncommon: skin rashes, pruritus Very rare: photosensitivity reactions Renal and urinary disorders Uncommon: urinary retention Reproductive system and breast disorders Very common: sexual dysfunction Rare: hyperprolactinaemia/galactorrhoea Very rare: priapism Musculoskeletal disorders Rare: arthralgia, myalgia General disorder and administration site conditions Common: asthenia, body weight gain Very rare: peripheral oedema WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS SEEN ON DISCONTINUATION OF PAROXETINE TREATMENT Discontinuation of paroxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia and electric shock sensations), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, and visual disturbances are the most commonly reported reactions. Generally these events are mild to moderate and are self-limiting, however, in some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when paroxetine treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Adverse events from paediatric clinical trials In short-term (up to 10-12 weeks) clinical trials in children and adolescents, the following adverse events were observed in paroxetine treated patients at a frequency of at least 2% of patients and occurred at a rate at least twice that of placebo were: increased suicidal related behaviours (including suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), self-harm behaviours and increased hostility. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts were mainly observed in clinical trials of adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder. Increased hostility occurred particularly in children with obsessive compulsive disorder, and especially in younger children less than 12 years of age. Additional events that were more often seen in the paroxetine compared to placebo group were: decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, agitation, emotional lability (including crying and mood fluctuations). In studies that used a tapering regimen, symptoms reported during the taper phase or upon discontinuation of paroxetine at a frequency of at least 2% of patients and occurred at a rate at least twice that of placebo were: emotional lability (including crying, mood fluctuations, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide), nervousness, dizziness, nausea and abdominal pain (see section 4.4 ).']]]],

              u'ulcers*, dysphagia*, abdominal distension, acid regurgitation. Uncommon: Nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis* oesophageal erosions*, melaena. Rare: Oesophageal stricture*, oropharyngeal ulceration*, upper gastrointestinal PUB (perforations, ulcers, bleeding), a causal relationship cannot be ruled out. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Uncommon: Rash, pruritus, erythema,. Rare: Skin rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: Isolated cases of severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Not known: alopecia Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: Common: Musculoskeletal pain (bones, muscles or joints) Rare: Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by bisphosphonates. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection (including osteomyelitis). Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors; severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see 4.4 \u2018Special warnings and precautions for use\u2019). Not known: joint swelling, stress fractures of the proximal femoral shaft (see section 4.4). General disorders and administration site conditions: Rare:. Transient symptoms as in an acute phase reaction (myalgia, malaise and in rare cases fever) usually in connection with the start of treatment. Not known: Asthenia, peripheral edema. *See sections 4.4 and 4.2. Laboratory values: In clinical trials, asymptomatic, slight and transient decreases in serum calcium and serum phosphate were observed in approx. 18 and 10 % respectively of the patients taking alendronate 10 mg/day versus 12 and 3 % respectively of those taking placebo. However, the incidence of reductions in serum calcium to <2.0 mmol/l and serum phosphate to <0.65 mmol/l was comparable in the two groups.']]]],

Consumption of a diet low in fat will decrease the likelihood of experiencing adverse gastrointestinal reactions (see section 4.4). Adverse events are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100, <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000, <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000, <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). The frequencies of adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use of orlistat are not known as these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

In patients with congestive heart failure, worsening cardiac failure and fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol dose (see section 4.4). Cardiac failure is a commonly reported adverse event in both placebo and carvedilol-treated patients (14.5% and 15.4% respectively, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction). Reversible deterioration of renal function has been observed with carvedilol therapy in chronic heart failure patients with low blood pressure, ischaemic heart disease and diffuse vascular disease and/or underlying renal insufficiency (see section 4.4). As a class, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers may cause latent diabetes to become manifest, manifest diabetes to be aggravated, and blood glucose counter-regulation to be inhibited. Carvedilol may cause urinary incontinence in women which resolves upon discontinuation of the medication.']]]],

              u'dysphagia*, abdominal distension, acid regurgitation Uncommon: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis*,oesophageal erosions*, melena Rare: oesophageal stricture*, oropharyngeal ulceration*, upper gastrointestinal PUBs (perforation, ulcers, bleeding)(see section 4.4) *See sections 4.2 and 4.4 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Uncommon: rash, pruritus, erythema Rare: rash with photosensitivity Very rare and isolated cases: isolated cases of severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain Rare: Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by bisphosphonates. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis). Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors; severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions: Rare: transient symptoms as in an acute-phase response (myalgia, malaise and rarely, fever), typically in association with initiation of treatment. During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): Nervous system disorders: dizziness, dysgeusia Ear and labyrinth disorders: vertigo Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: joint swelling, stress fractures of the proximal femoral shaft (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, peripheral oedema Laboratory test findings In clinical studies, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18 and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/day versus approximately 12 and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to <8.0 mg/dl (2.0 mmol/l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/dl (0.65 mmol/l) were similar in both treatment groups.']]]],

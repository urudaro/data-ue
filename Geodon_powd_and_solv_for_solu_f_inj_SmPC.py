Ziprasidone causes a mild to moderate dose-related prolongation of the QT interval (see section 5.1). In schizophrenia clinical trials, an increase of 30 to 60 msec was seen in 12.3% (976/7941) of ECG tracings from ziprasidone-treated and 7.5% (73/975) of ECG tracings from placebo-treated patients. A prolongation of >60 msec was seen in 1.6% (128/7941) and 1.2% (12/975) of tracings from ziprasidone and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of QTc interval prolongation above 500 msec was 3 in a total of 3266 (0.1%) in ziprasidone treated patients and 1 in a total of 538 (0.2%) in placebo treated patients. Comparable findings were observed in bipolar mania clinical trials. In long term maintenance treatment in schizophrenia clinical trials, prolactin levels in patients treated with ziprasidone were sometimes elevated, but, in most patients, returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment. In addition, potential clinical manifestations (e.g. gynaecomastia and breast enlargement) were rare.

Concentrations of inorganic fluoride generally peak within two hours of the end of Sevoflurane anaesthesia and return to normal within 48 hours to pre-operative levels. In clinical trials, elevated fluoride concentrations were not associated with impairment of renal function. **** May be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, particularly in association with long term occupational exposure to inhaled anaesthetics, including Sevoflurane.']]]],

Extrapyramidal disorder may occur: Parkinsonism (salivary hypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian gait, and glabellar reflex abnormal), akathisia (akathisia, restlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), tremor, dyskinesia (dyskinesia, muscle twitching, choreoathetosis, athetosis, and myoclonus), dystonia. Dystonia includes dystonia, muscle spasms, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle contractions involuntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial spasm, laryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, and trismus. Tremor includes tremor and parkinsonian rest tremor. It should be noted that a broader spectrum of symptoms are included, that do not necessarily have an extrapyramidal origin. The following is a list of additional ADRs associated with risperidone that have been identified as ADRs during clinical trials investigating the long-acting injectable risperidone formulation but were not determined to be ADRs in the clinical trials investigating oral risperidone. This table excludes those ADRs specifically associated with the formulation or injection route of administration of risperidone. Additional Adverse Drug Reactions Reported With long acting injectable risperidone but Not With oral risperidone by System Organ Class Investigations Weight decreased, Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, Hepatic enzyme increased Cardiac disorders Bradycardia Blood and lymphatic system disorders Neutropenia Nervous system disorders Paresthesia, Convulsion Eye disorders Blepharospasm Ear and labyrinth disorders Vertigo Gastrointestinal disorders Toothache, Tongue spasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Eczema Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Buttock pain Infections and infestations Lower respiratory tract infection, Infection, Gastroenteritis, Subcutaneous abscess Injury and poisoning Fall Vascular disorders Hypertension General disorders and administration site conditions Pain Psychiatric disorders Depression Class effects As with other antipsychotics, very rare cases of QT prolongation have been reported postmarketing with risperidone. Other class-related cardiac effects reported with antipsychotics which prolong QT interval include ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, sudden death, cardiac arrest and Torsades de Pointes. Weight gain The proportions of risperidone and placebo-treated adult patients with schizophrenia meeting a weight gain criterion of > 7% of body weight were compared in a pool of 6- to 8-week, placebo-controlled trials, revealing a statistically significantly greater incidence of weight gain for risperidone (18%) compared to placebo (9%). In a pool of placebo-controlled 3-week studies in adult patients with acute mania, the incidence of weight increase of > 7% at endpoint was comparable in the risperidone (2.5%) and placebo (2.4%) groups, and was slightly higher in the active-control group (3.5%). In a population of children and adolescents with conduct and other disruptive behaviour disorders, in long term studies, weight increased by a mean of 7.3 kg after 12 months of treatment. The expected weight gain for normal children between 5-12 years of age is 3 to 5 kg per year. From 12-16 years of age, this magnitude of gaining 3 to 5 kg per year is maintained for girls, while boys gain approximately 5 kg per year. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Cases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein thrombosis have been reported with antipsychotic drugs \u2013 Frequency unknown. Additional information on special populations Adverse drug reactions that were reported with higher incidence in elderly patients with dementia or paediatric patients than in adult populations are described below: Elderly patients with dementia Transient ischaemic attack and cerebrovascular accident were ADRs reported in clinical trials with a frequency of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively, in elderly patients with dementia. In addition, the following ADRs were reported with a frequency > 5% in elderly patients with dementia and with at least twice the frequency seen in other adult populations: urinary tract infection, peripheral oedema, lethargy, and cough. Paediatric patients The following ADRs were reported with a frequency > 5% in paediatric patients (5 to 17 years) and with at least twice the frequency seen in clinical trials in adults: somnolence/sedation, fatigue, headache, increased appetite, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, dizziness, cough, pyrexia, tremor, diarrhoea, and enuresis.']]]],

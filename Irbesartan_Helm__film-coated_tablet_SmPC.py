In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group and 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. Common: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in irbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable clinical musculoskeletal events. In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been observed. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Not known: hyperkalaemia Immune system disorders: Not known: hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria. Hepato-biliary disorders: Not known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function.']]]],

              u'abdominal pain (3.5% vs. 3.3%), diarrhoea (3.0% vs. 2.7%) Uncommon: gastritis (0.9% vs. 0.7%), oesophagitis (0.9% vs. 0.9%), dysphagia (0.4% vs. 0.2%), duodenitis (0.2% vs. 0.1%), oesophageal ulcer (0.2% vs. 0.2%) Rare: glossitis (<0.1% vs. 0.1%), oesophageal stricture (<0.1% vs. 0.0%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissues disorders: Common: musculoskeletal pain (2.1% vs. 1.9%) Investigations: Rare: abnormal liver function tests* * No relevant incidences from Phase III osteoporosis studies; frequency based on adverse event/laboratory/rechallenge findings in earlier clinical trials. In a one-year, double-blind, multicentre study comparing risedronate 5 mg daily (n= 480) and risedronate sodium 35 mg weekly (n=485) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles were similar. The following additional adverse experiences considered possibly or probably drug related by investigators have been reported (incidence greater in risedronate 35 mg than in risedronate sodium 5 mg group): gastrointestinal disorder (1.6% vs. 1.0%) and pain (1.2% vs. 0.8%). Laboratory findings: Early, transient, asymptomatic and mild decreases in serum calcium and phosphate levels have been observed in some patients. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-marketing use (frequency unknown): Eye disorders: iritis, uveitis Muskuloskeletal and connective tissues disorders: osteonecrosis of the jaw Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: hypersensitivity and skin reactions, including angioedema, generalised rash, urticaria and bullous skin reactions, some severe including isolated reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis hair loss. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction Hepatobiliary disorders: serious hepatic disorders. In most of the reported cases the patients were also treated with other products known to cause hepatic disorders. Calcium carbonate/vitamin D3 Adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and frequency following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100; <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000; <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000; <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) . Metabolism and nutrition disorders Uncommon: Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. Gastrointestinal disorders Rare: Constipation, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Skin and subcutaneous disorders Rare: Pruritus, rash and urticaria.']]]],

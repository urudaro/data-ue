              u'hypersensitivity anaphylactic reactions, angiooedema including swelling of the larynx and glottis causing airway obstruction and/or swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue; in some of these patients angiooedema had been reported in the past in connection with the administration of other medicines, including ACE inhibitors; vasculitis, including Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Nervous system disorders: Not known: migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Not known: cough Gastrointestinal disorders: Not known: diarrhoea, pancreatitis Hepatobiliary disorders: Rare: hepatitis Not known: liver function abnormalities Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Not known: urticaria, pruritus, rash, photosensitivity reaction Muscoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Not known: myalgia, arthralgia, Rhabdomyolysis Renal disorders: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in patients at risk; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4) Investigations: Not known: hyponatraemia In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of losartan tablets. Elevations of ALT occurred rarely and usually resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. Hyperkalaemia (serum potassium >5.5 mmol/l) occurred in 1.5% of patients in hypertension clinical trials. In a clinical study conducted in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy, 9.9% of patients treated with losartan tablets developed hyperkalaemia >5.5 mEq/l and 3.4% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4, \u2018Electrolyte imbalances\u2019) In a controlled clinical trial on patients with cardiac insufficiency, increase in blood urea, serum creatinine and serum potassium has been reported. The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients appears to be similar to that seen in adult patients. Data in the pediatric population are limited.']]]],

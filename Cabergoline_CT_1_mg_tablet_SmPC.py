There is limited information available on the reversibility of these reactions. Gastric upset was more frequent in female than in male patients, while CNS events were more frequent in the elderly. A blood pressure decrease of clinical relevance was observed mainly on standing in a minority of patients. The effect was mainly evident in the first weeks of therapy. Neither modification of heart rate nor consistent changes of ECG tracing were observed during cabergoline treatment. Alterations in standard laboratory tests are uncommon during long term therapy with cabergoline. In clinical studies, increases of triglycerides greater than 30% above the upper limit of the laboratory reference range were observed in 6.8% of the cabergoline-treated patients who had values within the normal range at baseline. In most cases the increases were transient. No clear indications of increases over time or significant shifts from normal to abnormal values were observed in the overall group of patients treated with cabergoline. Other: Adverse events have been reported with lower doses of cabergoline (0.25 \u2013 2 mg per week) that are not listed above including: Common (>1/100 to <1/10) Nervous system disorders: Depression, paresthesia. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Facial redness Uncommon (>1/1000 to <1/100) Eye disorders: Hemianopsia Vascular disorders: Nose bleeding Rare (>1/10000 to <1/1000) Vascular disorders: Fainting']]]],

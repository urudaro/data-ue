Although measured faecal fat excretion may increase, there is no evidence to date that long-term treatment with octreotide has led to nutritional deficiency due to malabsorption. Occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects may be reduced by avoiding meals around the time of octreotide administration, that is, by injecting between meals or on retiring to bed. The following adverse drug reactions, listed in Table 1, have been accumulated from clinical studies with octreotide and spontaneously reported adverse reactions: Adverse reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common ( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are ranked in order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1 Immune system disorders'],

With the exception of isolated gastrointestinal disorders (like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) and dizziness, no relevant differences in terms of type, frequency and severity of adverse reactions were identified between the safety profile for paediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years and that previously reported for adult patients. Neurocognitive and developmental assessment of paediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years of age revealed no overall clinically relevant adverse impact after treatment with Angiosan for up to one year. In a double-blind randomized study in 90 children aged 1 to 6 years, which was followed by a one-year open label extension, two deaths and isolated cases of marked liver transaminases elevations were observed. These cases occurred in a population who had significant comorbidities. A causal relationship to Angiosan has not been established. In a second study in which 75 children aged 1 to 6 years were randomised, no significant liver transaminase elevations or death occurred with valsartan treatment. Hyperkalaemia was more frequently observed in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with underlying chronic kidney disease. The safety profile seen in controlled-clinical studies in adult patients with post-myocardial infarction and/or heart failure varies from the overall safety profile seen in hypertensive patients. This may relate to the patients underlying disease. ADRs that occurred in adult patients with post-myocardial infarction and/or heart failure patients are listed below.

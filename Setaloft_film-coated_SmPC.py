Withdrawal symptoms seen on discontinuation of sertraline treatment Discontinuation of sertraline (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor and headache are the most commonly reported. Generally these events are mild to moderate and are self-limiting; however, in some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when sertraline treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Elderly population SSRIs or SNRIs including sertraline have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatraemia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see section 4.4). Paediatric population In over 600 paediatric patients treated with sertraline, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. The following adverse reactions were reported from controlled trials (n=281 patients treated with sertraline): Very common (\u22651/10): Headache (22 %), insomnia (21 %), diarrhoea (11 %) and nausea (15 %). Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10): Chest pain, mania, pyrexia, vomiting, anorexia, affect lability, aggression, agitation, nervousness, disturbance in attention, dizziness, hyperkinesia, migraine, somnolence, tremor, visual disturbance, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nightmare, fatigue, urinary incontinence, rash, acne, epistaxis, flatulence. Uncommon (\u22651/1 000 to <1/100): ECG QT prolonged, suicide attempt, convulsion, extrapyramidal disorder, paraesthesia, depression, hallucination, purpura, hyperventilation, anaemia, hepatic function abnormal, alanine aminotransferase increased, cystitis, herpes simplex, otitis externa, ear pain, eye pain, mydriasis, malaise, haematuria, rash pustular, rhinitis, injury, weight decreased, muscle twitching, abnormal dreams, apathy, albuminuria, pollakiuria, polyuria, breast pain, menstrual disorder, alopecia, dermatitis, skin disorder, skin odour abnormal, urticaria, bruxism, flushing.']]]],

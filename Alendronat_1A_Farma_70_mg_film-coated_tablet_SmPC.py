Uncommon: Nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis* oesophageal erosions*, melaena. Rare: Oesophageal stricture*, oropharyngeal ulceration*, upper gastrointestinal PUB (perforations, ulcers, bleeding) (see section 4.4). *See sections 4.2 and 4.4. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Uncommon: rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: Isolated cases of severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Common: Musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain Rare: Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by bisphosphonates. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection (including osteomyelistis). Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors; severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4). Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Rare: Symptomatic hypocalcaemia, generally in connection with predisposing conditions (see section 4.4). General disorders and administration site conditions: Rare: Transient symptoms as in an acute phase reaction (myalgia, malaise and in rare cases fever) usually in connection with the start of treatment. Immune system disorders: Rare: hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and angioedema. During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Ear and labyrinth disorders: Vertigo Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Joint swelling General disorders and administration site conditions Asthenia, peripheral oedema Laboratory values: In clinical trials, asymptomatic, slight and transient decreases in serum calcium and serum phosphate were observed in approx. 18 and 10 % respectively of the patients taking alendronate 10 mg/day versus 12 and 3 % respectively of those taking placebo. However, the incidence of reductions in serum calcium to < 8.0 mg/dl (2.0 mmol/l) and serum phosphate to <2.0 mg/dl (0.65 mmol/l was comparable in the two groups.']]]],

Psychiatric disorders \u2022Rare: altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations. \u2022Very rare: agitation, psychotic symptoms. Nervous system disorders \u2022Common: headache. \u2022Rare: dizziness, somnolence, decreased consciousness. \u2022Very rare: tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, convulsions, encephalopathy, coma. The above events are usually seen in patients with renal impairment receiving doses greater Page 6 of 11 than those recommended or in patients with other predisposing factors (especially the elderly, see section 4.4). These neurological disorders are common in transplant recipients receiving high doses of valaciclovir for the prophylaxis of infections and diseases caused by CMV. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \u2022Uncommon: dyspnoea. Gastrointestinal disorders \u2022Common: nausea. \u2022Rare: abdominal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhoea. Hepato-biliary disorders \u2022Very rare: reversible increases of bilirubin and serum hepatic enzyme levels. These are occasionally described as hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \u2022Uncommon: rash, including photosensitivity. \u2022Rare: pruritus. \u2022Very rare: urticaria, angioedema. Renal and urinary disorders \u2022Rare: renal impairment. \u2022Very rare: increased blood urea and creatinine, acute renal failure, sometimes with crystal precipitation in the tubule lumen, in particular in elderly or renally impaired patients when the doses used exceed those recommended. There have been reports of renal insufficiency, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (sometimes in combination) in severely immunocompromised patients, particularly those with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, receiving high doses (8 g daily) of valaciclovir for prolonged periods in clinical trials. These findings have been observed in patients not treated with valaciclovir who have the same underlying or concurrent conditions.']]]],

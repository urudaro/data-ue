              u'were nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia and gastritis. Cardiac disorders The cardiovascular system was involved in 27% of cases, most frequently reported event being cardiac valvulopathy and hypotension. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders The respiratory system was involved in 13% of cases, symptomatic pleural effusion/fibrosis being reported with a frequency <2%. Other adverse events expected for the pharmacological class, in view of the vasoconstrictive properties, include angina (reported in about 1% of the patients on cabergoline) and erythromelalgia (observed in 0.4% of the patients). Similarly expected for the pharmacological class, peripheral oedema occurred in 6% of patients. Gastric upset was more frequent in female than in male patients, while CNS events were more frequent in the elderly. A blood pressure decrease of clinical relevance was observed mainly on standing in a minority of patients. The effect was mainly evident in the first weeks of therapy. Neither modification of heart rate nor consistent changes of ECG tracing were observed during cabergoline treatment. Alterations in standard laboratory tests are uncommon during long term therapy with cabergoline. In clinical studies, increases of triglycerides greater than 30% above the upper limit of the laboratory reference range were observed in 6.8% of the cabergoline-treated patients who had values within the normal range at baseline. In most cases the increases were transient. No clear indications of increases over time or significant shifts from normal to abnormal values were observed in the overall group of patients treated with cabergoline. A clinically relevant decrease in haemoglobin, haematocrit and/or red blood cell count >15% (vs baseline) was observed at least once in 6.8% of clinical study patients with normal values at entry; normalisation was observed in one third of these patients. The following undesirable effects have been observed during treatment with cabergoline with the following frequencies: Very common (\u22651/10), Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) including isolated reports. *Undesirable effects that have been reported with lower doses of cabergoline (0.25 2 mg per week). Psychiatric disorders Common Depression*, hallucinations, confusion Not known (cannot be estimated from the Pathological gambling, increased libido and available data) hypersexuality, generally reversible upon reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation Nervous system disorders Very common Dyskinesia, dizziness, hyperkinesia. Common Somnolence*, headache*, fatigue*, paresthesia* Uncommon Sudden sleep onset episodes Eye disorders Uncommon Hemianopia* Cardiac disorders Very common Cardiac valvulopathy (including regurgitation) and related disorders (pericarditis and pericardial effusion) Common Chest pain, palpitations* Vascular disorders Very common Orthostatic hypotension (mainly evident in the first weeks of therapy) Uncommon Nose bleeding*, erythromelalgia Rare Syncope* Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Common Symptomatic pleural effusion/pulmonary fibrosis/pleuritis Gastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea Common Vomiting, gastric pains, dyspepsia , gastritis, constipation*. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common Facial redness* Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders Rare Cramp in fingers and calves* General disorders and administration site conditions Common Peripheral oedema Investigations Common Fall in haemoglobin and haematocrit values, fall in the erythrocyte count, increases of triglycerides Post-marketing surveillance Cabergoline is associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes. Patients treated with dopamine agonists for treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, including cabergoline, especially at high doses, have been reported as showing pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality, generally reversible upon reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation.']]]],
